# Claude MM Tool - Project Instructions

## Code Quality

### Linting

**Always run `./run lint fix` before committing code.**

This project uses Ruff for linting with a 100-character line limit. Auto-fix handles most issues:

```bash
./run lint fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
./run lint        # Check for remaining issues
```

**When to run:**
- Before every commit
- After writing/modifying Python code
- As part of the push workflow

## Git Commit Guidelines

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT include "Co-Authored-By" lines in commit messages.**

When creating commits, write clear, concise commit messages that focus on what changed and why, without attribution lines.

### Before Every Commit

1. **Run linting**: `./run lint fix` to auto-fix issues
2. **Verify**: `./run lint` to check for remaining errors
3. **Fix manually**: Address any errors that couldn't be auto-fixed
4. **Stage changes**: Include any files modified by lint fix
5. **Commit**: Create the commit

## Push Workflow

When the user says "push", follow this workflow in order:

1. **Auto-fix lint**: Run `./run lint fix` to auto-fix any linting issues
2. **Manually fix remaining lint errors**: If `./run lint fix` couldn't fix all errors, manually fix them
3. **Verify lint**: Run `./run lint` to confirm all linting errors are resolved
4. **Fix test failures**: Run `./run test` and fix any failing tests
5. **Push**: Run `git push` to push commits to remote

**Important:**
- Always run `./run lint fix` first before manual fixes
- Do not push if linting errors remain
- Do not push if tests fail

## Skill Development Workflow

**When modifying the mm-review skill:**

1. **Edit locally**: Make changes to `claude/skills/mm-review/skill.md` in this repo
2. **Test installation**: Run `./run install` to copy the skill to `~/.claude/skills/mm-review/`
3. **Test the skill**: Use the skill in a Claude session to verify changes
4. **Commit changes**: Only commit changes to the local `claude/skills/mm-review/skill.md`

**IMPORTANT: NEVER manually copy files to `~/.claude/` - always use `./run install` for testing.**

The installation script handles:
- Copying skill files to the global `~/.claude/skills/` directory
- Ensuring proper file structure and permissions
- Allowing you to test changes before committing
